# rg.vim

The goal of this plugin is to allow running ripgrep, via an external command, from
within vim and neatly presenting the results in a scratch buffer for manipulation,
nagivation (via `gF` and others), and viewing.

## Installation

I recommend using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).

## Dependencies

Depends on [rg](https://github.com/strindberg/rg)
